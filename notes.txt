- Instead of spectating a specific game, spectate a specific user, eg,
    https://royalechess.org/spectate?user=sereyuu
  And if the player is not in a game, show a pop-up message saying the player
  is not currently playing, then redirect to main lobby
  When a player starts spectating, they should send a "beginSpectate" event
  to let the server know, and when the socket disconnects, the player should
  stop spectating ...
  Design decisions surrounding spectator mode can be put off for the future,
  but for now, we can identify games by user instead of by some generated id.
