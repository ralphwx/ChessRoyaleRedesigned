- Instead of spectating a specific game, spectate a specific user, eg,
    https://royalechess.org/spectate?user=sereyuu
  And if the player is not in a game, show a pop-up message saying the player
  is not currently playing, then redirect to main lobby
  When a player starts spectating, they should send a "beginSpectate" event
  to let the server know, and when the socket disconnects, the player should
  stop spectating ...
  Design decisions surrounding spectator mode can be put off for the future,
  but for now, we can identify games by user instead of by some generated id.

- Implement rematch as a private challenge sent from one person to another?
  That way they can view the private challenge even if they're in the lobby
  screen. Implementation detail, if two people send private challenges to each
  other, then automatically pair them up

- Later, implement a mechanism such that when someone issues an open challenge,
  and there are already at least [n] open challenges available, then perform
  automatic matchmaking. Probably, match the newest person joining the open
  challenges list with the player of nearest elo

- The lobbydata object should keep track of which users need to know about
  which changes. This is because games are currently tracked based on the
  usernames of the two players, so the lobbydata object is already inherently
  tracking which users need to know about which games.
