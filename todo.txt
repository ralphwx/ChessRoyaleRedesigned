Currently working on:
- Update the controller with arrow drawing functionality.

TODO:
- Write tests for server backend, make sure to include cases where the
    user is logged in, user is guest, and login request was never sent.
- Implement and test the feature where if two people private challenge each
    other, then they're automatically paired up.
- Add sound effects and game start animation
- Make the size of arrows on game screen adapt to chess board size
- Future: write tests for spectator mode functionality (where user is requesting
  game data corresponding to other users)
