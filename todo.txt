Currently working on:
- Implement replay
  - Set up ReplayDesktop first then fill in the details for ReplayController
- See how the display looks on different screens
- Make the rules of the game page look pretty, include diagrams, etc. Add fair
  play rules to "how to play" page

TODO:
- Add tests for things user screwing things up via JS console (eg, username
    or password) (I mean, technically that's cheating/hacking ...)
- Add thread safety features to all data structures
- Implement a settings screen
- Make a proper test server for testing code ...
- Add a list of tasks for sending code to production
- Write tests for spectator mode functionality (where user is requesting
  game data corresponding to other users)
- Make game info bar reflect whether the opponent is online
- learn SQL?

Tasks for interns if I ever get any:
- Improve the bots and write bot benchmarks
- Make arrows size adapt to window size
- Add sound effects and game start animation
- Attempt to hack my server, as is. Make a test suite of attempted hacks
